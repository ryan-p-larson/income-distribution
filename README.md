#Historical Income Distribution (USA)

Income-distribution is a repo with a small visualization from the U.S. Census Bureau. My motivation is to examine how incomes have changed over time in the United States. A lot of different media sources talk about 'The 1%', and how they have been getting more and more wealth. I wanted to know if this was just a talking point; and if it wasn't, by how much?

The dataset can be found at the **U.S. Census Bureau** [here.](https://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/inequality/) A description of the dataset taken from the website:
> Census money income is defined as income received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. Therefore, money income does not reflect the fact that some families receive part of their income in the form of noncash benefits, such as food stamps, health benefits, subsidized housing, and goods produced and consumed on the farm.
